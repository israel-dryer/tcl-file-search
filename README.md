# tcl-file-search
A local file search engine built with tcl/tk

This is a personal learning project that was created to help me learn tcl/tk. In the process, I also learned how to work with threaded messages to update the gui and perform long-running processes for the searching functionality.

It's not intended to be a complete production ready project; but if you feel like using it, extending it, or learning from it, then you are more than welcome.
